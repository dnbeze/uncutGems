Global oil consumption
We forecast that global consumption of liquid fuels will increase by 1.1 million b/d in 2024 and 1.5 million b/d in 2025. Most of the expected growth is from non-OECD countries, which increase their liquid fuels consumption by 1.1 million b/d in 2024 and 1.3 million b/d in 2025. The growth in non-OECD consumption is led by China and India, which we expect will increase consumption by a combined 0.6 million b/d in 2024 and 0.7 million b/d in 2025. In addition, we expect an increase in liquid fuels consumption from non-OECD Asia because of increased bunker fuel demand driven by Red Sea disruptions and longer shipping routes for tankers. We expect increases related to bunker fuels will contribute around 10% of total oil consumption growth in 2024. In OECD countries, liquid fuels consumption stays relatively flat in 2024 and increases by 0.3 million b/d in 2025.
