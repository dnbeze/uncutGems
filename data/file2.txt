Global oil production We expect OPEC+ will largely adhere to production targets announced on June 2. The announcement extends the additional voluntary production cuts by countries such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, which were set to expire at the end of June 2024, through September 2024. Beginning in October, these member countries plan to gradually phase out their production cuts on a monthly basis through the end of September 2025. In addition, the round of production cuts that OPEC+ participants announced in April 2023 and were set to expire at the end of 2024 were also extended through the end of 2025. Given the extension of these production cuts, our expectation is that OPEC+ crude oil production will follow these new targets until early 2025. At that time, we expect that some OPEC+ producers will keep production below the targets in an effort to limit global oil inventory builds.
