Global oil prices and inventories
The Brent crude oil spot price averaged $82 per barrel (b) in May, down $8/b from April. Daily spot prices also initially fell following the OPEC+ announcement on June 2, closing at $78/b on June 6. The extension of OPEC+ cuts through 3Q24 led us to reduce our forecast for OPEC+ oil production for the rest of 2024. We expect less OPEC+ production for the rest of this year will cause Brent prices to rise to an average of $85/b during the second half of 2024 (2H24). Because of less OPEC+ production, we expect more oil will be withdrawn from global inventories in 2H24 than we did last month. Despite more inventory draws in this monthâ€™s forecast, we lowered our expectation for the annual average Brent price in 2024 compared with the May STEO to reflect the lower starting point for the forecast resulting from the recent price decline.
